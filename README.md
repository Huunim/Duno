# Duno
 A programming-like utility for general purpose tasks
 
Duno is a programming-like utility for general purpose tasks
calculations, operations on strings, files and file systems, to call functions
system and pop-up graphical controls.
The specific language is Duno-code. A language designed by me to be the
simplest possible, so much so that you can learn in 10 minutes, why
limited to performing the most common functions quickly.
But there are also some special and unique features.
