# Duno
 A programming-like utility for general purpose tasks
 
Duno is a programming-like utility for general purpose tasks
calculations, operations on strings, files and file systems, to call functions
system and pop-up graphical controls.
The specific language is Duno-code. A language designed by me to be the
simplest possible, so much so that you can learn in 10 minutes, why
limited to performing the most common functions quickly.
But there are also some special and unique features.

## Duno is the interpreter of the DunoCode language.

Grant execute PERMISSION to the AppImage package.

>   In Wayland session, the program runs with XWayland.
> 
>   To run Duno with wayland protocol, type on the terminal:
> 
>   export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
> 
>   then launch Duno from terminal. e.g.: $ /home/$USER/Applications/DunoCode....


It is possible to add the program to the menu and also create an association between
scripts with the .du extension and the interpreter, with one click.
Move the AppImage package, without renaming it, to a home folder
called 'Applications', open the program the first time and from the menu
(Interpreter) select ( Install ).
If your .du files don't open with the Duno interpreter, you may need to
restart the system.

Desktop shortcut, menu and icon association can be also performed manually. 
As well as the association of the scripts to the program.

The program creates a home folder for quick saving scripts.

The basic instructions and special functions of the interpreter can be found in
program itself: from the menu (Interpreter) -> (Help)

Duno allows you to run:  
  code 'on the fly' written in the text area of the interpreter;    
  text files, opening them from the program ;    
  text file with .du extension on double click, with the program closed
   (if pairing is successful).     
  scripts called from data files.
